    "description": "The development of new techniques for analyzing and controlling stochastic processes that are described as Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN). In our approach, we focus on identifying the most important parameters of the system and controlling them to achieve the desired changes in the system behavior using various stochastic optimization methods. In particular, at the current stage we investigate the possibility of controlling the Circadian clock gene regulatory network, finding the optimal rates for maintaining the period of its oscillation. This work can find its application in the development of new diagnostic techniques and medicine.",

The problem of multiple RNA interaction is very recent and previous solutions have been very limited in scope. We have devised exact and approximation algorithms based on dynamic programming to the predict the joint structure of multiple RNA sequences. Recently, we have developed algorithms to predict multiple solutions. Our work has a direct impact on understanding behavior of RNAs in the spliceosome.",

    "description": "A robot must locate and retrieve an artifact that is sending signals, but has limited battery life. First Scenario: All calculations are completed by a centralized computer that is accepting and analyzing the signals from the artifact. These signals contain estimates of the distance of the central computer to the artifact. Once all calculations are completed, the robot is then sent to the rescue. This approach allows a cheaper rescue robot, that is not equipped with the sensors and capability to execute the algorithms, but comes at the cost of time spent collecting signals. The risk factor is incorrectly estimating the location of the artifact, and thus not being able to locate it if the less equipped robot is only in the proximity of it. Second Scenario: The robot is equipped with computational and sensing capabilities and it performs the optimization in real time as it moves towards the artifact. The risk factor is associated with the extra consumption of energy while executing the task, and probability of damage to more expensive equipment. We study the convergence of executing estimation analysis and algorithm execution while in motion.",

We seek minimal cost satisfying a constraint of the form P(b,u) < a. Both functions are steady state averages of a stationary complex process: function evaluations are very costly. We combine Fibonacci search in b with gradient search in u to find the optimal solution and propose a sequential sampling for minimal computation. We analyze convergence and discuss parallel computation. The methods are illustrated with a problem in public transportation where buses take people to and from the airport terminals to the parking lots.",

    "description": "Battery lifetime is a significant bottleneck on wireless sensor network performance. Thus, one of the fundamental problems in sensor networks is optimizing battery usage when accomplishing tasks such as covering, monitoring, tracking and communicating. In one paper [BRT13] we study the problem of covering a boundary or a barrier by mobile sensors, e.g., covering borders, coastlines, railroads, etc. Also, often covering region boundaries is the cost efficient way of protecting the interior. The focus of this paper is to determine what is the most energy efficient way of covering a straight-line barrier for a predetermined amount of time with mobile sensors given some initial arrangement of these sensors on the barrier. Prior work tried to optimize either covering costs or mobility costs but not a combination of both costs. We consider a model where energy is consumed by sensing and movement from a single battery source as is most commonly the architecture. In another paper [BRT15] we assume that a sensor can maintain coverage until its battery is completely depleted. The network of sensors cover the barrier until the death of the first sensor, whereby a gap in coverage is created and the life of the network expires. In a third paper [BBR13] we consider the Set Once Strip Cover problem, in which n wireless sensors are deployed over a one-dimensional region. Each sensor has a fixed battery that drains in inverse proportion to a radius that can be set just once, but activated at any time. The problem is to find an assignment of radii and activation times that maximizes the length of time during which the entire region is covered.",

In the project we are developing new algorithms, involving stochastic optimization, which can automatically tune the parameters of such sequential tests to fit examples of desired behavior. Hopefully this will improve the practice of designing online classification systems.Prof Stamos provides the application framework and datasets and he is mentoring Thomas for the completion of his 3D online classification project.
